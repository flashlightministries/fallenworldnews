MONTGOMERY, AL - Alabama has banned same-sex divorce, inflaming the debate over same-sex marriage only two years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Obergefell v. Hodges to legalize it.

HB 5439, titled "An Act to Protect Same-Sex Marriage," begins, ""With the recognition of same-sex marriage, it is incumbent upon the state of Alabama to enforce that law according to the legal, historical and traditional definition of marriage.  Seeing that same-sex marriage is defined as the union between two men or two women for life, this state government shall not allow for same-sex divorce."

"You want marriage till death do you part, you got it," inveighed one congressional staffer to the protesters gathered outside the capitol building shortly after the governor signed the bill into law.

Fronting the throng of booing protestors were Jose and Harold Gomez-Jefferson, a couple married one week prior in the courthouse across the street.  According to Jose, he and Harold were no longer on speaking terms after Harold brought home two Starbucks barristas and a stockbroker to cook tapas, play Cards Against Humanity and soak in their hottub.  "Harry didn't even call me to come home.  It's just not fair that I now need to spend the rest of my life with this jerk," said Jose, referring to his estranged husband who was nearby chanting "Freedom Now!" along with the crowd while pumping his fist in the air.

A group of Christians cheered nearby, some of them holding placards saying, "'I hate divorce' - Love, God. (Mal. 2:16)"

In a press briefing given by House majority leader Jack Harper (R), when asked why they banned divorce for same-sex marriages but not all marriages, he said, "A bill banning all divorce wouldn't fly, but at least this gets closer to the mark."
