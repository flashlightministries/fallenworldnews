MADISON, WI - Satanist William Reese would like everyone to know that he and most other satanists don't actually believe in Satan.  "We simply stand for scientific rationalism and freedom, and against the evils of Christianity," he said.

Dressed in all black with a beaded necklace bearing the head of Baphomet, the goat-headed bisexual idol worshipped by pagans in centuries past, Reese sipped from a can of Mountain Dew and began to explain how his beliefs don't actually constitute a religion.

"We believe all religions are superstitious," Reese said.  He runs a chapter of the After School Satan Clubs, a program for children created by the Satanic Temple to counter the Christian Good News Clubs which they say "focus on indoctrination, instilling [kids] with a fear of Hell [sic] and God's wrath."

Reese explained, "We like to have fun while we teach kids about critical reasoning and creative expression.  We sing songs, do art projects and basically celebrate life and our freedom from overbearing authorities."

Anton LaVey, the founder of the Church of Satan, once described satanism as "a secular philosophy of rationalism and self-preservation (natural law, animal state), giftwrapping these ideas in religious trappings to add to their appeal."

Reese agreed with that statement.  "It's not so much what we stand for as much as what we stand against -- the cruel lies of Christianity," he said.

When asked if the term "satanic" was a bit misleading, and perhaps "antichrist" would more accurately describe his group, Reese responded, "I'm deeply offended that you would call me or anyone I love an antichrist.  We're good people.  I see now that you're just a bunch of religious whack-jobs.  You know what?  I'm not going to put up with your name-calling," and walked out of the interview.
