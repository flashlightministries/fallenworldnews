The targeting of abortion clinics by pro-life activists has raised concerns for the safety of their staff, creating the demand for a new robotic solution to terminate pregnancies without the need of human intervention.  Los Angeles-based biotech firm Final Solution Automation (Nasdaq: FSAU) is spearheading this new twist on an ancient industry by introducing automated abortion facilities throughout California.

"We don't like to use the term 'abortion'," says their CEO Margaret Singer, "because of its divisive history.  We prefer to call it 'cell cluster evacuation'.  Our lab technicians have nicknamed the robot Dolly."

Singer says the rollout of their cell cluster evacuation units will focus first on college campuses, explaining that "the younger generation gets it.  These people spend most of their lives plugged into their phones, sifting through social media and zoning out to music.  According to our research, they would rather not deal with other humans in a stuffy clinic when a machine could take care of their most sensitive and intimate needs in a clean and efficient manner."

Brian, an undergraduate Philosophy major at UC Berkeley who requested to identify himself by first name only, confirmed FSA's findings.  "I think it's great.  The choice to have an abortion is a matter that should be left up to the mother, and the mother alone.  I don't like the idea of some rich white male doctor even being involved in that process."

Singer says her company is also in negotiations with a very large retailer to provide in-store solutions.  "It makes sense to locate our services in the communities where family management is lacking and cost savings matter most, and this retailer already has a physical presence and reputation for convenience among these people groups."

The scientific community seems to support this technology trend.  When asked about robot gynecologists performing surgery, Neil deGrasse Tyson confidently declared, "Go for it."

But support for abortion robots is far from unanimous.

Pro-life groups have unified to voice their strong objections to abortion robots, releasing a collective statement to the media that began, "We unanimously reject the practice of human abortion, and we stand firmly against the practice of murder whether in the womb or in the world, whether committed at the hands of human beings or in the grips of robotic ones."

When asked about the prospect of abortion robots, Pastor Jonathan MacDonald of Grace Baptist Church in Sacramento reacted with incredulity.  "I don't know if we've gone completely insane as a country or if I'm losing my own mind.  Is that really true?  Abortion robots?"

MacDonald regained his composure after taking a sip of water and patting sweat from his brow with a handkerchief.  "I guess this shouldn't come as a surprise. It's natural for mankind to lust after the flesh, and to idolize our lifestyle and the things we create with our hands rather than worshipping our Creator.  These factors logically lead to abortion, even abortion robots."  Opening his Bible, he turned to Romans 1 and began reading at verse 20.

"For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened."

MacDonald silently turned to Psalm 139.  "In this passage, David is speaking to God."  He read,

> For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my motherâ€™s womb. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.  Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.

MacDonald closed his Bible, and still looking down, he said, "Jesus Christ said in Matthew 19 to forbid not the little children, for of such is the kingdom of heaven."

After a pause, he began to pray.  "Dear Lord, I pray that you intervene to put a stop to this madness.  Please forgive those who murder your children out of ignorance and self-interest.  Change their minds to appreciate the sanctity of all life you have given us, and change their hearts to love you above all things with all their heart, soul, mind and strength.  Put in us your Spirit, Lord, to guide us in bringing this change through your perfect wisdom, and that not of our own, and give us the words to teach the truth in love, humility and patience. Amen."

UCLA Political Science professor Greg Brown addressed the issue from another perspective.  "What we need to remember is that new ideas always face some pushback in a democracy such as ours.  Real innovation is not only a technical challenge, but also a battle for the hearts and minds.  In the evolution of ideas, the weakest holdouts from the past will be eliminated in favor of superior ones.  Certain conservative religious groups may not like these changes, but change is key to a better and more exciting future, a future we must embrace if we are to survive and flourish."
