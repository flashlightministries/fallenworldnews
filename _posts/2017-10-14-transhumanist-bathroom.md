A press release from Target states, "We're pleased to extend equal bathroom rights to individuals who have transcended their identity as mere human beings.  Whether these beings are in transition as cyborgs or have completed their transformation into fully-inorganic entities, Target welcomes them to freely use any of our bathrooms along with the straight and LGBTQ communities."

Transhumanists believe that, as technological advancement progresses at an exponential, soon humans will be able to upload their consciousness into a universal information system and eliminate their defect-ridden flesh-suits, thus achieving immortality.  In the meantime, some of them augment their bodies with various accessories.

"This is a huge win for transhumanist rights," said an individual known as Vog Tetradyne, who describes himself as a "mechanized man," able to transform into four different forms for fighting, flying, running and working as a sandwich artist at Subway.  "The singularity is near!" he screamed in excitement.

A spokesperson for a conservative Christian ministry that is boycotting Target over its transgender bathroom policy declined to comment at length, saying that "some people should seek counseling" and recommending that they read John 3:36:

> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
