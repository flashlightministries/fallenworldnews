> And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done (Romans 1:28).

A woman shall not wear a man’s garment, nor shall a man put on a woman’s cloak, for whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD your God (Dt 22:5).

Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind (1Co 6:9 KJV).

Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body (1Co 6:19-20).

Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness (2Th 2:9–12 KJV).

The Washington Post is fascinated by Martine Rothblatt, the millionaire founder of Sirius XM.  Rothblatt has undergone elective sex reassignment surgery, a misnomer because only God assigns gender (Psa 139:13-16).  But more crucially, such an operation mocks God's sovereignty as creator and attempts to usurp His perfect creative powers (Gen 1:27; Exo 20:3-5; Prv 21:2; Mat 19:4).

Take notice of the word "cybercreator" in the WP headline.

Rothblatt wants eternal life so bad that he invented his own religion in an attempt to achieve immortality through the advancement of technology and worship based on eastern paganism mixed with his own philosophy.  Spiritually speaking, unbelievers like Rothblatt are the walking dead, and unless they accept Jesus as their savior, they will never live, no matter how much they value their own ideas (Eph 2:1-2; Rom 6:23; 2Ti 3:7).

Later this week, a group called Intelligence Squared will host a public debate on this issue of whether artificial intelligence is the path to salvation or to destruction.  Rothblatt will argue that AI and other technologies offer our only hope for eternal life, and afterward the audience will decide the verdict by popular vote (Isa 5:21; Prv 3:7, 26:12).

Only Jesus Christ is the way, the truth and the life (Jn 14:6).  Artificial intelligence will not guide the unrepentant to truth or eternal life.  Their only hope is to know the Word of God guided by the Holy Spirit, to accept the free gift of salvation and to remember the knowledge they've always possessed, but in their wickedness they've suppressed (Jn 14:26; Eph 2:8-9; Rom 1:18).

The amazing fact is that you were known by God before you existed (Psa 139:13-16).
