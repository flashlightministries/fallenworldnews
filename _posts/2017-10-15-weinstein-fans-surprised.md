As details came out describing the predatory behavior committed by Harvey Weinstein over the decades, fans of his movies reacted with shock and dismay.

Waiting in line to see a paranormal slasher flick, a fan named John said, "This news about Weinstein is almost as horrifying as that one rape scene in Pulp Fiction, but not nearly as entertaining. Awesome movie, but this... this is, like, real."

His girlfriend Heather agreed, saying, "I laughed when Travolta shot that guy in the back seat and they had to mop up his blood and bones and stuff -- that was so funny -- but I'm not laughing at this.  How could somebody behave so insensitively?"

"Totally," John said.  "I never saw this coming."
