A new study published in Nature this month has revealed staggering new evidence suggesting that the earliest human being lived in a garden-like setting.

"We call the various species of prehistoric humans cave-dwellers, but that's misleading," said lead researcher Max Grolsch at the University of Amsterdam, thoughtfully biting down on the earpiece of his bifocals.  "You see, nature was everywhere back then, everybody living with trees and grass and things.  All these nice things, you see."

When Grolsch appeared to fall into a daydream while staring out his window, his assistant Helena De Vries shook her head and excused herself from the room.  Later, when asked, she explained that none of the professor's musings would come as a surprise to any Christian.

"There aren't many Christians in my country," De Vries said of her native Netherlands, "so I think the obvious is lost on many of them.  They simply haven't read the Bible, or they don't believe it.  I've worked for a number of research scientists at this university, and I can tell you that they could all benefit from reading and believing in the Bible."

After taking a sip of tea, De Vries continued.  "One professor did work on the Big Bang and was very pleased with herself for deciding that the universe, indeed, had a singular beginning. Another researcher, a political scientist, made a career out of demonstrating that we live in a world of nations speaking different languages, fighting wars and never seeming to resolve our conflicts. When I was reassigned, I gave him a small gift with a card attached, and in that card I had written out Genesis 11:1-9, the story of the tower of Babel."

She laughed.  "I'm hoping my next assignment will have me working with an astrobiologist, so I can gently explain to him or her why life is found only on the earth."
