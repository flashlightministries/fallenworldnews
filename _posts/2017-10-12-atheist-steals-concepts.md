The friendship between atheist Jason Montgomery and his best friend Victor Hu, a Christian, was strained to the breaking point last week after Montgomery refused to return the concepts he had stolen from Christianity to construct his godless worldview.

"Dude, just admit it," implored Hu, clearly exasperated.  "You say you don't believe in God, but you've based your whole worldview on ideas put forth in the Bible."

Montgomery crossed his arms and shook his head, saying tersely, "No I haven't."

"I have a question for you, then," Hu said.  "Do you think Jeffrey Dahmer was evil?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

"Because he killed and ate people."

"What's so evil about killing and eating people?"

Montgomery blinked in astonishment, then finally answered.  "Because it's not good for the survival and propagation of our species.  Our selfish genes want to multiply, so any behavior that would lead to our extinction is evil."

Hu responded, "Using your subjective measure, one could argue that a starving person killing and eating a weak and undesirable person is a net positive for propagating the species -- this is the logic of eugenics, and even abortion when you think about it."

"Oh, please.  Abortion?"

"Abortion.  This is where we get into the objective moral standard of God versus the relativism of man's philosophy.  Without God, you have no grounds for positing good and evil.  With your atheist worldview, you can embrace subjective concepts like whether something is efficacious or deleterious for survival, which is an arbitrary calculus based on an assumption about what our genes want, but you can't make sense of the objective spiritual concepts like good and evil that you already know as an image-bearer of God."

"Don't tell me what concepts I can and can't have.  I can have whatever concepts I want."

Hu picked up his phone and said, "Genesis 2:17."  He tapped the screen and read, "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."

Montgomery snickered.  "You think I care about what that stupid book says?"

"No, actually, I don't think you care about what this book says.  At least not yet.  I'm the one who cares about this book, so I check everything against what it says.  You, on the other hand, consider yourself to be the ultimate authority on good and evil, so you check with yourself.  Do you know what the serpent in the garden said to Eve about eating from that tree of the knowledge of good and evil?"

"No, and I don't care."

Hu called up Genesis 3:5.  "Here's what the serpent said: 'For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.'  You see, that's truth mixed with a big lie."

"Everything in that Bible is a lie, man."

"As long as you deny God, you have no right to use these concepts of objective moral truth. Please, Jason, return them back to where they belong, with God and the Bible."

The two men stared at each other in silence, then agreed to resume their game of Mario Kart, already in progress.
