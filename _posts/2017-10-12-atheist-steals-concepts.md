The friendship between atheist Jason Montgomery and his best friend Victor Hu, a Christian, was strained to the breaking point last week after Montgomery refused to return the concepts he had stolen to construct his godless worldview.

"Dude, just admit it," implored Hu, clearly exasperated.  "You say you don't believe in God, but you've based your whole worldview on ideas put forth in the Bible."

Montgomery crossed his arms and shook his head, saying tersely, "No I haven't."

"I have a question for you, then," Hu said.  "Do you think Charles Manson is evil?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

"Because he killed a bunch of people."

"No, Manson didn't kill any--"

"I mean he started a cult and had his followers kill people."

"Okay, so why is murdering people evil?"

Montgomery hardly paused before answering.  "Because it's not good for the survival and propagation of our species.  Our selfish genes want to multiply, so any behavior that would lead to our extinction is evil."

Hu responded, "Without God, you have no grounds for positing good and evil.  You can have cold, factual judgments like whether something is efficacious or deleterious for survival, but not spiritual concepts like good and evil."

"Don't tell me what concepts I can and can't have.  I can have whatever concepts I want."

Hu picked up his phone, pressed a button and said, "Genesis 2:17."  He tapped the screen and read, "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."

Montgomery snickered.  "You think I care about what that stupid book says?"

"No, actually, I don't think you care about what this book says.  At least not yet.  I'm the one who cares about this book, so I check everything against what it says.  You, on the other hand, consider yourself to be the ultimate authority on good and evil, so you check with yourself.  Do you know what the serpent in the garden said to Eve about eating from that tree of the knowledge of good and evil?"

"No, and I don't care."

Hu called up Genesis 3:5.  "Here's what the serpent said: 'For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.'  You see, that's truth mixed with a big lie."

"Everything in that Bible is a lie, man."

"Please, Jason, return these concepts of good and evil to God and the Bible, where they belong."

The two men stared at each other in silence, then mutually decided to resume their game of Mario Kart, already in progress.
